# projects

This repo has all my mini projects and exercises listed. They come from different study sources and are organized as such. Feel free to look around and pilfer what you find interesting.

- [100devs](https://www.twitch.tv/learnwithleon) is an online bootcamp and community
- books contains exercises from various books
- [cs50](https://www.edx.org/cs50) is an introduction to computer science course
- [exercism](https://exercism.io/) is an online platform that provides free coding practice and mentorship
- [rwxrob](https://rwx.gg/) is an online Linux bootcamp and community
- [udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) is an online platform with many coding related courses

So far I have been interested in finding high quality and free study resources. These are, with the exception of Udacity, all my resources. However, due to this year's pandemic, Udacity also provided their courses for a limited amount of time free of charge.
