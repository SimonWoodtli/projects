## Coursera - Learning to learn summary

I really enjoyed this course and there are a few things that really changed my view on learning. The concept of chunking is really interesting. I think I already kind of used this idea when I learned to play guitar 4 years ago. I just kept practicing tiny parts of a song until I got it right, and then I kept practicing until I got to the end of the song. And the mesh of how a piece relates to other pieces, even in completely different areas, is amazing. I think that overall the course offered many opportunities to improve our learning.

My Top 10:
1. exercise
2. create a mental picture for difficult concepts (metaphor)
3. learn to create habits
4. how procastination is actually a pain
5. Einstellung
6. Deliberate practice
7. 4slot working memory
8. practice (learn by doing) and deep focus
9. people in your life to be inspired
10. importance of sleep
